<h1>The Best Movies According to CreedSNR</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr \>

<h3>Karate Kid</h3>
<p>It is a nice and interesting movie, it shows the will of a young man and his determination to win against all odds.</p>
<h3>Irobot</h3>
<p>Will Smith did justice to the movie. A man against robots but he continued to fight till he was victorious.</p>
<h3>A Good Day To Die Hard</h3>
<p>Bruce Willis really showed the world how action films should be acted. The movie had a good story, nice moves and a never-ending peserverance from the protagonist.</p>
